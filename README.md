# GDP and Life Expectancy Analysis

This project analyzes the correlation between GDP and life expectancy across various countries. Using data from multiple nations, the analysis explores whether economic growth correlates with improvements in public health, specifically life expectancy.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To examine the relationship between GDP and life expectancy using scatter plots and Pearson correlation coefficients.
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, Statsmodels.
- **Results**: A strong positive correlation was found between GDP and life expectancy in most countries, with some notable outliers.

## Files

- `GDP_LEABY.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, visualizations, and correlation calculations.
- `all_data.csv`: The dataset containing GDP and life expectancy values for different countries.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions for use.

## How to Use

1. Download the [**GDP_LEABY.ipynb**](dataset/GDP_LEABY.ipynb) file from the `dataset` folder.
2. Open it in [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/install).
3. Run the cells to execute the analysis and explore the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across different countries.
4. Review the visualizations and results to understand the trends and correlation values calculated.
